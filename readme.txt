This modification (for SMF 2.0 Final only) adds a header "List-Unsusbscribe" to the e-mails sent by SMF.
This header is the unsubscribe link of a topic for notifications, if exist is. Else, it's a link to the email of the webmaster.

[b][i]This header is essential to comply with the rules of good email delivery practices.[/i][/b]

[b]NOTE: No adjustment necessary, install and that's all![/b]


[i]Tested on a fresh SMF installation.[/i]
